## Individual Projects

### 1. Sticker Generator

An Android App where the user can generate a grid of sticker image, and the user can also save that image for further uses. In the backend **GAN** model is used to generate new Images and by using rest API those images bring to android app. 

Project Source code:  [Sticker Generator]( https://github.com/Iamsdt/StickerGenerator )

Notebook: [Anim Generator Gan PyTorch](https://www.kaggle.com/iamsdt/anim-generator-gan-pytorch)

Server Code: [Server Code](https://github.com/Iamsdt/StickerGenerator/tree/master/server)

### 2. Multilabel Movie Poster Classification
Multilabel image classification to classify movie poster and find appropriate movie genre with movie poster. For this project tensorflow framwork is used for deep learning model. The model is converted into tf lite to reduce final model size. This is a complete project with server side code and also fronted. To deploy deep learning model, flask is used and deployed into heroku server. By using Flutter framework frontend web app is developed and deployed into firebase.

### 3. Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

The goal of this algorithm is to detect dog breed.  If this algorithm detects human, then it will be predicted which dog breed he or she looks like. Or, if detect dog, then it will be predicted dog breed. This project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

Project: [Dog App](https://github.com/Iamsdt/UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree/blob/master/CNN/Project2/dog_app.ipynb)

### 4. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

The goal of this project is to predict daily bike rental ridership. In this project, neural network was created from scratch using python and the used dataset contains the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012.

Project: [Source code](https://github.com/Iamsdt/UdacityDeepLearningNanodegree/tree/master/projects/first_neural_network-269560)

### 5. Speech Recognition with Neural Networks

The goal of this project to build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! The completed pipeline will accept raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language. In this project, different types of architecture are used to find out the best model for this dataset. They are -
1. RNN
2. RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
3. CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
4. Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
5. Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
